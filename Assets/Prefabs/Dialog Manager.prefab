  sentences:
  - Nothing is in your control.
  - I'm just trying to get home.
  - 'What is home? '
  - I don't have time for this. You're a stranger and I'm late. You're not even a
    stranger. You're just a thing that appeared. Are you even a thing?
  - Would you like me to be.
  - 'Hey, hey, hey, thats for you to figure out. '
  - Do you want to see something cool?
  - People are staring. Leave me alone.
  - (Portal appears)
  - What is this?
  - 'Walk into it. '
  - What is it?
  - It's a portal
  - To where?
  - 'It depends. What have you got to loose? '
  - My life?
  - 'You humans are so dramatic. You dont even know what that means. How do you know
    that it even matters. What if you are created and destroyed and recreated again
    at the tap of a button by some higher civilisation that sees you as no more than
    a few pixels? '
  - Is that true?
  - 'Truth is relative to the world in which you exist in. '
  - What are you talking about?
  - Is everything a struggle with you?
  - You can't say unsubstantiated facts and then call me crazy for questioning you.
  - And here I was thinking you're worried about making a scene.
  - I'm just trying to get home!
  - 'Why are you so attached to that experience? All you do is walk around in circles
    in your head worrying about things that generally NEvER happen as you overthinked. '
  - Will I be able to get back if I go with you?
  - "The universe is a self repeating fractal, whatever life you were living in this
    world you will somehow replicate in your new one. There is and isn\u2019t a no
    normal. Every world that exists contains this moment right now. "
  - Where are you getting this stuff?
  - 'Think about it though. The solar system and the arrangemnt of nuclear molecules
    looks kinda similar. Maybe the sun is the nucleus of our universe and then the
    pattern extends further and further. Look up solar system and atom arrangement. '
  - I have no reason to trust this.
